    "## Data Cleaning Process Findings\n",
    "The overall data for the Colorado Springs, CO map area was very clean. After formatting and writing the data to CSV files, I used Oracle SQL to investigate the data with the following findings:\n",
    "1. Validity:  \n",
    "    - The sample schema given in the Udacity project directions was used. It needed to be adapted for Oracle SQL, mainly using different names for data types. (ex. TEXT vs. VARCHAR2 data types) No problems were found with data types matching the schema.\n",
    "2. Accuracy:\n",
    "    - Because the data is used by many people, the accuracy is subject to the users' perceptions. There are very few Map Notes in this area, indicating that it is likely to be relatively accurate.\n",
    "3. Completeness:\n",
    "    - When I imported the data to the database, I skipped over nodes with problem characters that might cause issues in the import process. This creates the risk that some information may be excluded unintentionally. An example of this is noted in the issues encountered section. Some phone number formats contained problem characters and were excluded. If this phone number format was used by a certain contributor, this could have caused unintentional exclusion of that contributor's data.\n",
    "4. Consistency:\n",
    "    - The random data points I investigated were consistent with other map sources (i.e. Google Maps)\n",
    "5. Uniformity:\n",
    "    - I ran queries on multiple tags, including postal codes, street types, and name direction pre/suffixes. I did not find any inconsistencies. Issues I looked for included duplicated types with different spellings and formatting. (ex. Ct vs. Court or S vs. South; see below query)\n",
    "    - Formatting was consistent throughout all addresses. Phone number formatting was not consistent. Some different formats found were:\n",
    "        - +1 ### ### ####\n",
    "        - +1-###-###-####\n",
    "        - +1 (###) ###-####\n",

    "        - Con: It would be complicated to anticipate and write code to correct each type of format. I would probably attempt to convert all of the phone numbers into a number format, removing any additional characters and then re-format them in the preferred way. This would probably involve quite a bit of trial and error.\n",
