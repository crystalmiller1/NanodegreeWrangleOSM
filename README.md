Map Area
Colorado Springs, CO USA

https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=13/38.9326/-104.8302
Colorado Springs is an area I lived in for 15 years. 
I learned how to drive and had a job delivering pizzas there so am very familiar with the area. 
I thought it would be interesting to see how the map data compares with my memories of the area and if I can improve it in any way.

Files Included:
